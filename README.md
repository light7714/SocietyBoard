# SocietyBoard
A Hack 2021 project attempt, my first hackathon (incomplete)
## Idea
In a college, there are many societies, with their own websites and social media pages. Whenever a society conducts an event or a recruitment drive, they post all details on their respective platforms. It is very unconvienient for a student if he/she wants to be updated with all the news. Many times the student can miss an event he/she would have liked to participate in.

To solve this problem, we had an idea to make a notice board like website displaying the current news about each society. The society head can make an account, and  then will be asked to enter their society name. They can post their upcoming event details, and it will be listed on the main page. A student can quickly see all the news from the main page without any hassle.
